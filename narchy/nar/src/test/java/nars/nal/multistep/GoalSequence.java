/**
 * I played a lot with 1.6.0 version for long time now. I'm am pleased that it
 * works that nicely.
 * 
 * However I found one thing which I think is crucial to make it more effective.
 * 
 * Lets say we have a sequence of actions which leads to a goal, like
 * "(&/,a,b,c) =/> d" with the goal "d!". We currently don't create such
 * statements by temporal induction, which currently means it will be like that:
 * 
 * a =/> b b =/> c c =/> d
 * 
 * with d being the goal, it will spawn c, then spawn b, then spawn a with even
 * less priority, now it will eventually execute a.
 * 
 * However, this is very ineffective, because it has to do every step
 * "mentally", with a ton of reasoning-overhead, which leads, altough working in
 * principial, to failing even for relatively simple examples.
 * 
 * Clearly with expressions like (&/,a,b,c), the execution could be achieved
 * with much less reasoning overhead for the system, it may work much better
 * then.
 * 
 * Any ideas of a strategy to generate statements like "(&/,a,b,c) =/> d" with
 * temporal induction in an effective way?

 * The core of the trie
 *
 * <p>This class implements a trie node. It has two elements in it:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>a boolean telling whether this node matches a full word;</li>
 *     <li>a list of children trie nodes, if any.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The children are indexed by the character they match (which means, in
 * effect, that a trie node has no characters "belonging" to him, and the root
 * node knows of all first characters there are to match).</p>

Rainbow Road
============

Description
-----------

The longest and most treacherous course in Mario Kart, Rainbow Road is a wild ride unlike any other. Its hypnotic curves and stomach-turning drops are enough to shake even the steadiest racers.

Driving through an Item Box will yield one of the following items:

Green Shells fire directly forward of the player.

Red Shells home in on the opponent whose rank is one higher than the player.

Blue Shells navigate along the track until it homes in on the player who is currently in first, potentially hitting other players along the way.

Banana Peels cause the kart to spin-out, slowing it down a little.

Fake Item Boxes resemble regular Item Boxes, but they are upside-down. Instead of bestowing items, they cause crashes.

Mushrooms grant a brief burst of speed. When using multiple mushrooms, it is more effective to space out the bursts rather than consuming them all at once.

Stars make the player temporarily invulnerable to all damage. In addition, a player using a star travels faster and can run over other players.

Thunderbolts temporarily shrink all the other racers making them slower and weaker. Shrunken players can be driven over.

In The Dark 4K
==============

Description
-----------

After being captured by the ghosts of last year, our sorcerer has been locked in a jail in the basements of the witch’s castle. 
After several months, he decides to escape. He can still shoot fireballs. 
And, because of the darkness, he uses a spell which produces a light above him, but it runs out over time. 
To revive it, he needs to kill creatures. So pay attention to his intensity...

To go upstairs through the 5 levels, he has to collect the coins scattered all over each one.

Good luck !

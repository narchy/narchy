Description

Yoshi's Coins (also known as Connect Four, Four in a Row, Four in a Line, Four Up, Plot Four and Find Four) is 
a turn-based game in which the players drop coins from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically-suspended grid. 
The coins fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The object of the game is to connect 
four yellow coins next to each other vertically, horizontally or diagonally before Yoshi does it with red coins.

You start off with 1 egg and each time you beat Yoshi, you gain another egg. 
For each egg you own, Yoshi becomes a more challenging opponent. 
If you own 7 eggs and you beat Yoshi, you win the tournament. Good luck!

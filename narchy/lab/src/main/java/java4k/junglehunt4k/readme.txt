Jungle Hunt 4K
==============

Description
-----------

The object of Jungle Hunt 4K is to rescue Sir Dashly's kidnapped mate, who, after hours of valiant fighting, 
was overpowered by two man-eating (and woman-eating) savages.

To rescue Lady P., you'll have to make your way past four sets of obstacles: the vines of the Deadly Forest, 
the crocodiles of Reptile River, a landslide of bouncing boulders, and the spears of the two masked cannibals. 
You'll score points for each obstacle Sir Dashly successfully overcomes; you'll also score bonus points for rescuing Lady P.

Since jungle hunting is a dangerous business, you are given five lives at the start of the game. 
The number of lives remaining is shown on the upper left of your screen. 
At 10,000 points you are given one extra life--if you survive that long!

When you begin the game you are given 500 seconds to reach Lady Penelope. A timer counts down the seconds until you reach her.

You'll score more bonus points for rescuing her quickly, so don't dawdle while you're jumping vines or avoiding crocodiles.

The obstacles you'll encounter on your adventure are:

Deadly Forest

The Deadly Forest is a swinging place once you get to know it. Here you'll test your coordination and 
timing as you jump from vine to vine. Since some vines swing faster than others, 
you'll have to time your leaps carefully. Make a wrong move, and Sir Dashly is finished!

Reptile River

The Reptile River is filled with schools of cantankerous crocodiles. Make Sir Dashly swim out of their way or 
fend them off with his knife.

Steer Dudley underwater, but keep your eyes on the air meter at the top of your screen. 
If Dudley is still underwater when the meter runs out, he'll have to breathe water--and you'll lose a life!

Boulder Field

After you successfully cross Reptile River, you'll encounter a landslide of tumbling boulders. 
There are two sizes of boulders: small rolling rocks and larger bouncing boulders. 
Leap over the small rocks to avoid getting crushed. Larger boulders are harder to avoid--you'll have to leap over, run under, 
or duck beneath them to keep out of their way.

Cannibal Camp

You're finally within reach of Lady Penelope, but she's being guarded by spear-wielding savages. 
You must guide our hero over the spears of the savages and run to the waiting arms of Lady Penelope. 
Watch out for the tips of the spears. They're poisoned!

After a tearful reunion with his beloved wife, Sir Dashly returns to the Deadly Forest for the next level of play. 
The game becomes increasingly difficult as you move on to higher levels. 
You can continue to play until you run out of players, or until the timer runs out.

The faster you rescue Lady P., the more bonus points you'll receive, so don't waste any time getting to her. 
The Deadly Forest can be especially time-consuming; practice jumping vine to vine as quickly as possible.

A crocodile's underbelly is particularly vulnerable; try to come from beneath when stabbing one.

If you wish to conserve lives, simply avoid the crocodiles instead of stabbing them.

To score extra points, try jumping over the larger boulders. 
You'll get up to four times more points than ducking or running beneath them. 
Time your jump carefully, though, since large boulders bounce higher than small boulders.


Instructions
------------

Use the arrow keys or the WASD keys to move. 
Press any other key to jump/attack. Within the Boulder Field, press down to duck. 
Inside of the Reptile River, press attack to knife the crocodiles.

On!

Description
-----------

Shoot stuff! Avoid enemies and their bullets! Use the enemies to heal yourself!

A shoot-em-up where your gun is always on!

Instructions
------------

Press the arrow keys to move your blue ship. 
Press the space bar to switch between the blue ion beam that hurts the enemies, 
and the purple ray that heals your ship.

Grab the purple circle to power up your purple ray, 
and the blue circle to expand your blue cannon.

Your ship can slide left and right, beyond what the window currently shows. 
Be careful with your movements - moving too fast can lead to disaster!

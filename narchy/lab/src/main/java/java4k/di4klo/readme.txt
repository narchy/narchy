Description
-----------

An ancient evil is lurking in the nearby catacombs. Some say they conceal a gate to Hell... 
The elders considered sending the village idiot to investigate the place for an acceptable loss. 
But as he fell ill the night before starting his quest, you were finally chosen to replace him, 
in your quality of Daemon Hunted...

+Key features :

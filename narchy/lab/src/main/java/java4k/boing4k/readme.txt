Boing 4K
========

Description
-----------

You have 60 seconds to go from one end of the course to the other. 
Pay attention to the time remaining bar displayed at the bottom of the frame. 
If you run out of time, you'll have to restart the course.

To beat the game, you need to conquer all 14 courses. Along the way, you'll encounter squares with different properties. 
Green circles make you bounce higher. Aqua bars do the opposite. Arrows force you to hop in a specified direction. 
Exclamation marks vanish after use. Question marks can do any of the above. Note, unmarked squares act as a kind of checkpoint. 
If you fall off the course, you'll return to the last unmarked square.

Instructions
------------

Use the arrow keys or the WASD keys to move. Position your shadow on the square that you want to land on.

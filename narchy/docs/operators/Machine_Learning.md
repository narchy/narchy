## Neural Network / Deep Belief Network
The set of input neurons and the set of output neurons can
be mapped to concepts by some function of priority and/or truths
to activation in a neural network model.  

Additionally the matrix of X input, Y output pairs can
be interpreted as X,Y relation concepts (ex: similarity) that 
represent a certain feature of the network (Ex:
co-activation the network has learned, or any other feature
suggested by it)

## Reinforcement Learning
Similar to FF networks described above, Q-learning can form
a matrix of implications between a set of input perceptions (concepts)
and a set of action responses (concepts).  The truth of the
determined implication may be considered similar 
to the Q-learning "Q-value".

1. System offers no assistance; operator does everything
2. System offers a complete set of action alternatives
3. System narrows action selection to some choices
4. System suggests one action
5. System executes a specific action if operator approves
6. System allows operator limited time to veto before automatic execution
7. System executes automatically then necessarily informs operator
8. System informs operator after automatic execution only if operator asks
9. System informs operator after automatic execution only if it decides to
10. System decides everything and acts autonomously, ignoring operator

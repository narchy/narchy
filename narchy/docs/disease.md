To illustrate how the thought framework I learned at Dalhousie Medical School is nothing like “Germ vs Terrain”, I’ll show people how I learned about diseases. The most common Mnemonic for the material causes of disease is VINDICATE.

 * __V__ - Vascular - blood flow problems.
 * __I__ - Iatrogenic - the doctor caused the disease.
 * __N__ - Neoplastic - Cancers.
 * __D__ - Degenerative - mechanical wear and tear.
 * __I__ - Infectious - things that multiply and spread.
 * __C__ - Congenital - the problem was there from birth.
 * __A__ - Autoimmune - body making antibody proteins against itself.
 * __T__ - Toxic - a poison.
 * __E__ - Endocrine - hormone imbalance or absence.

Injury is left off this list because for the most part, injuries as causes of illness are self evident; e.g. gravity causing a fall, inertia inside a moving car causing deceleration damage or the environmental extremes such as malnutrition, dehydration, or radiation causing direct cellular injury. Likewise Idiopathic / Unknown is also left out of “VINDICATE” because if all the known causes of disease are absent then all that is left is unknown / idiopathic.

So I simplified the 9 causes of illness down to 2.

Non-Living things that cause disease.

Living things that cause disease.

 * Non-Living things that cause disease are things like malnutrition (missing vitamins or nutrients), toxins like lead and arsenic, and environment (radiation, temperature or gravity.)
 * Living things that cause illness come in different sizes.

 * BIG - Bears, Sharks and Tigers.
 * Medium - visible parasites like mosquitoes, intestinal worms and leeches.
 * small - visible under a microscope.

Living things are called “living” by their ability to multiply, adapt to their environment and function according to a DNA or RNA blueprint. The Big and Medium living things are multicellular, while small living things can be multicellular (yeasts), or single cellular (solitary bacteria). However, regardless of their size, they all share the 3 basic properties of “Living”.

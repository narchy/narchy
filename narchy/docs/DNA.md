Decentralized Processing Units (DPUs)

## Controlled Chemical Reaction Rates Emulate Attention (Priority) Dynamics

The bandwidth of operable/controllable limits (ex: pressure/temperature/concentration space)
provides ways to modulate system activity and its relative process rates.

These may be self-regulating local 'microclimates' which occurr as a result or byproduct of
program activity, but can also be managed from higher levels of control hierarchy.

    * ex: ambient temperature control as a global process throttle

Temperature Instrumentation
  * DNA Thermocouple for encoding local temperature measurements; provides basic feedback about activity
  * External laser/optic temperature sensors model (a coarser) global volumetric temperature mesh

### Energy (Attention) Storage

## Breadth-first Grow

The analog of Breadth-first Search applied by a synthetic biological system

In geometric terms, it specifies the range of possible motion (hyper-cone) of growth to allocate

The two most general cases will involve across a surface or within a volume
 * Option: a growth topology of N-dimensions could map to 1D coordinates of a space-filling curve in a lower dimension.

May specify competition parameters when encountering competition.
For example, a difference in truth confidence and/or priority might encode the behavior to cannibalize the space and resources while intruding into a weaker zone.

# Growlog

A synthetic biology analog of Prolog

## Grow-points

The analog of a choice-point occurring in a search process by a synthetic biological system

## Back-tracking, Cuts

May be implemented as a growing pathway that can reach back to cut itself, or
provide feedback of some type.  Or this may exist virtually as a chemical signal
emitted by 'leaves' that asynchronously affects a 'branch'

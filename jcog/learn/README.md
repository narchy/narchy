# jcog-learn - Machine Learning Utilities for JCog

The `jcog-learn` module is designed to house a collection of machine learning algorithms, tools, and related utilities within the broader `jcog` ecosystem. Its primary purpose is to provide a robust set of functionalities that can be leveraged for building intelligent systems and applications requiring learning capabilities.

This README offers a high-level overview of the `jcog-learn` module. It is expected that this document will be expanded with more specific details, examples, and documentation as the module evolves or as contributors document its individual components and features more thoroughly.

## Purpose and Scope

`jcog-learn` aims to provide a versatile toolkit for developers working on machine learning tasks. While the specific contents will grow over time, this module may include tools and implementations for a variety of functionalities, such as:

*   **Classification:** Algorithms that categorize data into predefined classes.
*   **Regression:** Techniques for predicting continuous values.
*   **Clustering:** Methods for grouping similar data points together.
*   **Data Preprocessing:** Utilities for cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for machine learning models.
*   **Model Evaluation:** Tools for assessing the performance of learning algorithms.
*   **Neural Networks:** Components for building and training neural network architectures.
*   **Ensemble Methods:** Techniques that combine multiple learning algorithms to improve performance.
*   Implementations of various other supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning algorithms.

The above list indicates potential areas of development and inclusion, and the actual features will depend on contributions and the project's evolution.

## Relationship to `jcog`

`jcog-learn` is an integral part of the `jcog` project. As such, it is designed to seamlessly integrate with and leverage the core utilities provided by other `jcog` submodules. For instance, it might use:
*   `jcog-core` or `jcog-util` for fundamental data structures, mathematical functions, or collections.
*   `jcog-graph` for graph-based learning algorithms or representing model structures.
*   `jcog-evolve` for hyperparameter optimization of learning algorithms.

This synergy allows `jcog-learn` to benefit from the efficiency and robustness of the wider `jcog` framework while focusing specifically on machine learning tasks.

## Key Features

[Details about specific algorithms, implemented features, and their usage will be added here as the module is further developed and documented. Users and contributors are encouraged to help expand this section.]

Currently, users should explore the packages within `src/main/java` to discover available functionalities.

## Getting Started

To use components from the `jcog-learn` module in your project, you will typically need to add it as a Maven dependency in your project's `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.yourusername.jcog</groupId> <!-- Adjust groupID as per actual deployment -->
    <artifactId>jcog-learn</artifactId>
    <version>LATEST</version> <!-- Or specify a particular version -->
</dependency>
```
(Please adjust the `groupId` and `version` as per the actual coordinates in your Maven repository or the main project's build configuration.)

Once the dependency is added, you can import and use the classes and methods provided by the module. It is recommended to consult the specific Javadoc or source code of the classes and packages within `jcog-learn` for detailed API information and usage examples until this README is more comprehensively populated.

## Contributing

Contributions to the `jcog-learn` module are highly welcome, whether it's by adding new algorithms, improving existing ones, fixing bugs, or enhancing documentation.

If you have implemented a machine learning component or have expertise in a particular area, consider contributing it to `jcog-learn`. Improving this README by adding details about specific functionalities, examples, or best practices is also a valuable way to contribute. Please follow the general contribution guidelines for the `jcog` project.

We encourage users and developers to:
*   Document existing but undocumented features in this README or via Javadoc.
*   Provide examples of how to use specific algorithms or utilities.
*   Share insights into the strengths or use cases of particular components.

Your efforts will help make `jcog-learn` a more comprehensive and user-friendly machine learning library.

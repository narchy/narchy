/**
 * WARNING:  untested concurrency cases
 *
 *  modified from Conversant Disruptor's PushPullConcurrentQueue
 *
 * WARNING: do not use the .get(int) method.  instead use peek(int) which determines the
 * correct buffer position.  this is a consequence of extending AtomicReferenceArray for
 * efficiency purposes.  SORRY in advance for any confusion this might cause
 *
 * Originally:
     * Tuned version of Martin Thompson's push pull queue
     * <p>
     * Transfers from a single thread writer to a single thread reader are orders of nanoseconds (3-5)
     * <p>
     * This code is optimized and tested using a 64bit HotSpot JVM on an Intel x86-64 environment.  Other
     * environments should be carefully tested before using in production.
     * <p>

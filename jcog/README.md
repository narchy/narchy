# jcog - Foundational Utilities for Cognitive Software Development

JCog is a comprehensive collection of Java utilities and frameworks specifically engineered to serve as a robust foundation for the development of "cognitive software." This refers to applications that aim to emulate aspects of natural intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and perception. The philosophy behind `jcog` is to provide versatile, high-performance, and modular components that can be assembled in various ways to construct complex intelligent systems. It emphasizes efficiency, reusability, and the integration of diverse computational paradigms, from machine learning and graph theory to logic programming and real-time processing.

## Purpose and Philosophy

## Getting Started

Each submodule is structured as a separate Maven project. You can include them as dependencies in your `pom.xml` file as needed, allowing you to incorporate specific functionalities into your projects selectively.

Example (adding `jcog-graph`):
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.yourusername.jcog</groupId> <!-- Adjust groupID as per actual deployment -->
    <artifactId>jcog-graph</artifactId>
    <version>LATEST</version> <!-- Or specify a version -->
</dependency>
```

Refer to the main project's `README.md` for instructions on cloning and building the entire `jcog` suite.

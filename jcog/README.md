# jcog - Utilities for Cognitive Software

JCog is a collection of Java utilities and frameworks designed to support the development of cognitive software. It is organized into several submodules, each focusing on a specific area of functionality.

## Submodules

Here's a brief overview of the available submodules:

*   **`db`**: Provides utilities for database interactions and management.
*   **`evolve`**: Features the "Gen Framework," a system for evolution-powered dependency injection. It can automatically find optimal implementations and parameters for your code. See `evolve/README.md` for more details.
*   **`graph`**: Contains a rich set of graph data structures, algorithms (including traversal and pathfinding), and reflection-based utilities for dynamic graph manipulation.
*   **`http`**: Offers utilities for HTTP client and server operations.
*   **`io`**: Includes tools for various input/output operations.
*   **`learn`**: Provides machine learning algorithms and related packages. See `learn/README.md` for more details.
*   **`memoize`**: Offers utilities for function memoization to cache results of expensive computations.
*   **`net`**: Contains tools for networking tasks.
*   **`parse`**: Provides utilities for parsing various data formats.
*   **`pri`**: Focuses on data structures and algorithms related to priority, prioritization, and weighted collections. This includes priority queues, weighted bags, histograms, and related operations.
*   **`prolog`**: Enables integration with Prolog for logic programming capabilities.
*   **`realtime`**: Offers utilities for developing real-time systems.
*   **`rtree`**: Includes implementations of R-tree data structures, which are useful for spatial indexing.
*   **`util`**: A comprehensive utility library providing a wide array of tools for common programming tasks. This includes data structures (like Bloom filters, Roaring Bitmaps, trees), mathematical functions, reflection utilities, signal processing tools, log pattern matching, and much more.

## Getting Started

Each submodule is a separate Maven project. You can include them as dependencies in your project as needed.

## Contributing

Contributions to JCog are welcome! Please refer to the specific submodule's contribution guidelines if available.
